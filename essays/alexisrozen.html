    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Glass panels, steel frames, a sterile 5% formaldehyde solution, and a colossal tiger shark - these are the
            ingredients Damien Hirst utilized to craft his now-iconic piece, “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the
            Mind of Someone Living,” or more colloquially known as “The Shark” (1991). Suspended in its chemical bath,
            the preserved predator commands attention with its imposing presence and visceral symbolism. As viewers
            confront the eerie spectacle, they are drawn into a provocative exploration of life, death, and the human
            condition—an exploration that is as unsettling as it is profound. Hirst's artwork transcends the boundaries
            of traditional artistic expression. Yet, beneath the surface spectacle lies a complex web of controversies,
            criticisms, and ethical concerns that invite a deeper examination of the artwork's significance and impact
            on the art world. While Damien Hirst's shark undeniably provokes profound contemplation on mortality and the
            human condition, its artistic merit is ultimately overshadowed by the artist's relentless commercialization,
            which undermines the artwork's originality and raises ethical concerns about animal treatment.</p>

            Damien Hirst’s fascination with death and the preservation of animals can be traced back to his earliest
            artistic endeavors. Before becoming the multi-millionaire and often controversial figure known today, Hirst
            grew up in a working-class household in Bristol, England. During these formative years, he developed a keen
            interest in art, eventually attending classes and studying fine arts at university. It was within these
            artistic circles that Hirst became involved with the Young British Artists (YBAs), a loose collective known
            for their provocative and often shocking works. In 1988, Hirst co-curated (some argue single-handedly
            curated) a now-legendary exhibition titled "Freeze" that showcased the works of several YBAs. His opening
            piece, "With Dead Head," featured a photograph of Hirst holding a severed human head, obtained during his
            time working in a morgue, displayed alongside the actual head preserved in formaldehyde. This raw and
            confrontational work, while human rather than animal, foreshadowed the larger-scale explorations of
            mortality and the human body that would come to define Hirst's artistic journey. "With Dead Head" marked one
            of the first instances where an artist used such a visceral representation of death to challenge societal
            taboos surrounding mortality and human remains. Hirst's willingness to confront such sensitive subjects and
            provoke strong reactions from viewers became a hallmark of his artistic approach. The "Freeze" exhibition
            received critical acclaim, launching the careers of many YBAs, including Hirst himself.

            Hirst's fascination with death and the animal kingdom continued to fuel his artistic vision, culminating in
            the creation of the shark. The concept stemmed from his ongoing exploration of mortality and a personal
            fascination with marine life. In the late 1980s, Hirst approached an Australian shark hunter and
            commissioned him to catch a tiger shark specifically for this artwork. The colossal creature was then
            preserved in formaldehyde, a chemical solution commonly used in embalming, effectively halting the natural
            process of decay. Similar to "With Dead Head," this piece served as a powerful confrontation of mortality.
            The once-fearsome predator now hangs suspended in a state of perpetual lifelessness, prompting viewers to
            contemplate their own transient existence. From a technical standpoint, the preservation required immense
            skill in taxidermy and meticulous attention to detail. Suspending a gigantic dead animal in liquid and
            ensuring its longevity for public viewing was a process that reportedly took Hirst months to master. The
            final creation – a seemingly life-size tiger shark floating serenely within the formaldehyde solution –
            became one of the most talked-about pieces of modern art, sparking reflection on the complex relationship
            humanity has with the natural world and beyond. This groundbreaking piece transcended the art world,
            capturing the imagination of a wider audience and becoming a cultural phenomenon.

            Many, however, saw through the emotions and acclaim and were quick to bring up the boundless ethical issues
            of using deceased creatures as artistic materials. Hirst provides little to no detail regarding the sourcing
            and conditions under which these animals were obtained. This lack of transparency raises questions regarding
            whether Hirst adheres to ethical guidelines for the treatment of animals and the environment. For the tiger
            shark used in Hirst’s shark, this species is classified as “near threatened” by the International Union for
            Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While not necessarily endangered, this designation means their population
            faces serious threats from overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction, and the killing of this shark
            for art goes against the countless conservation efforts made by environmentalists. Furthermore, the
            exploitation of protected animals and the reduction of a magnificent shark to a mere object of spectacle
            leaves a distinctly bitter taste. No matter how beautiful the exhibit may be, the fact remains that these
            animals were killed for human pleasure and as a commodity. Hirst’s clear focus on the consumer audience
            stretches far beyond the ethical concerns of animal preservation and environmental conservation. His
            willingness to sacrifice the lives of creatures for artistic gain highlights the darker underbelly of the
            art world and raises important questions about the responsibility of artists to consider the broader
            implications of their work on the natural world and future generations.

            While Hirst’s shark was initially commissioned by collector Charles Saatchi, Hirst's later decision to
            mass-produce editions of the artwork stands as a quintessential example of his push towards
            commercialization and commodification. Initially, Hirst used the hysteria surrounding his pieces to drive
            critical thinking and discussion, yet he now leverages it to generate substantial financial returns. He
            established a mass production factory, perfectly calculating a strategy to capitalize on his artificial fame
            and market appeal, eventually selling the pieces for millions. By transforming the preserved shark into a
            highly sought-after commodity, Hirst blurs the line between artistry and commerce, prioritizing profit over
            artistic integrity. Hirst utilizes other artists to make his pieces for him, despite selling them as
            original “Damien Hirst” creations. While many artists utilize assistants to help streamline their creation
            process, Hirst takes it to another level. He collaborated with several technicians, taxidermists,
            preservationists, and artists like himself to be able to mass-produce his artwork, yet frustratingly, this
            credit appears to be lost in regards to the pieces themselves. When asked why he didn't do any of his own
            work anymore, he responded quite sharply, “Because I couldn't be f***ing arsed doing it.” Yet, these
            paintings still sell for millions with a Hirst label, and his net worth keeps rising. The original “Freeze”
            exhibit was held in a run-down factory, with the artworks being the main focus of the exhibition. Yet,
            Hirst's recent marketing strategies concerning the shark appear to be taking a completely opposite direction
            from his humble beginnings. As Hirst relentlessly pursues continued commercial success, selling out to
            luxury brand collaborations and further compromising his artistic integrity.

            Damien Hirst’s “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living” transcends its status as
            a mere artwork to become a profound exhibition on the human condition and the nature of mankind itself. The
            colossal predator, frozen in a sterile solution, becomes a mirror reflecting our own impermanence. Through
            this stark juxtaposition of life and death, Hirst confronts viewers with the fundamental realities of
            mortality. The artwork goes beyond its visual impact, sparking a wave of uncertainty and questioning whether
            we are any different from this magnificent creature now resigned to a silent form. We desperately cling to
            life, yet the shark only amplifies the ever-present reality of death. While the artwork’s power is
            undeniable, Hirst’s relentless commercialization of this profound statement into a mass-produced image and
            allegations of plagiarism and outsourcing of labor cast severe doubt on Hirst's claim of artistic authorship
            and originality. It makes me question his motives - is this artistic genius or a calculated manipulation of
            the market? Despite these complexities, the artwork remains a powerful and thought-provoking confrontation
            of the finitude of existence. Perhaps that's the true genius of this piece - its ability to compel us to
            grapple with the taboo and difficult topic of mortality. Damien Hirst’s shark, in its silent form, serves as
            a powerful call to action. By reminding us of our limited time, the artwork compels us to make the most of
            our existence, to live with purpose, and to leave our own mark on the world before we too become suspended
            in a formaldehyde memory.
