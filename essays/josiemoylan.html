            The era of cinema is dying due to greed in the field. With chain theatres in this age, decisions for which
            films get screen time are solely influenced by their profit potential— their respective qualities are not
            relevant in this decision making process. While this is a typical business model, it’s killing the art of
            cinema. For this reason, local theatres are ever more valuable. Cinemapolis is a local first-run theatre in
            Ithaca that specialises in independent, foreign, and locally-produced films. They provide a space to run
            these smaller films that would otherwise not have the opportunity to be displayed on the big screen. That
            being said, not all of these films can be hits. Sometimes there are actual reasons that these films don’t
            have the same success as mainstream movies. In the case of “Hundreds of Beavers”, there are no actual
            reasons. While we went to this film expecting the absolute worst, instead we received a truly magical 1 hour
            and 48 minutes; this was simply a stellar film through-and-through. There was no better way to have spent my
            spring break than to view this phenomenal film at a phenomenal theatre with some of my phenomenal friends.
        </p>

            This freshly released work stands out against its competitors. As a black-and-white silent film, there is no
            doubt that it defies mainstream conventions, and a break in the monotony of movie viewing was much needed.
            With actors dressed as beavers and other miscellaneous forest animals there is nothing “typical” about this
            movie. Even if one failed to enjoy their time spent watching “Hundreds of Beavers”, they would not be able
            to deny that it takes the audience by surprise. Varsity themselves, a respected review tabloid based in the
            United Kingdom, referred to it as “truly a unicorn of a film. You have to see it to believe it.” I think
            this is a compliment, but there really is no way to be sure. This slapstick comedy follows an ex-applejack
            salesman, who previously had a substantial alcohol dependence, on his journey of survival in a snow covered
            terrain. How he ended up by himself in this desolate landscape is unanswered, but the peculiarity serves to
            add to the bafflement of the audience. This is not your typical zero to hero story. Jean Kayak, a
            protagonist of sorts, uses his wits, also of sorts, to create increasingly complex traps to capture various
            wildlife. At first, his primary motivator was one of survival. Purely driven by hunger, he hunted to avoid
            starvation. As he developed his tactics and found success with these revisions, these motives transformed
            from surviving to thriving. In order to win the hand of the local tradesman’s promiscuous daughter, he
            captures hundreds of beavers, a condition established by the tradesman himself. On a separate tangent, who
            doesn’t love an allusion to the title of the movie within the movie? Going from a drunk to North America’s
            greatest fur trapper is no simple feat, and Kayak deserves great recognition for doing just that. I believe
            “Hundreds of Beavers” is one of the greatest fictional success stories of my time— an opinion that Rotten
            Tomatoes might agree with based on their 95% approval rating.

            My initial reaction to this “unicorn of a film” was one of high admiration, but I was unsure if I should be
            ashamed of this response to such an absurd film. Was this genuinely a good movie? Or do I just have bad
            taste? While the odds of the latter are low, I decided that perhaps I should conduct a very biased poll to
            confirm my own beliefs. My journey to Cinemapolis to view this film was not one that was traversed
            unaccompanied. Three friends, with three differing opinions, were by my side during this viewing. To give
            credit where credit is due, I will name drop these friends: Natalia, Morgen, and Laura. Now, if it is
            decided that I should be ashamed of my opinion, they too must be ashamed.

        </p>
        <p>
            Natalia specifically loved the sound effects. It takes very little to entertain her, so the juvenile noises
            were enough to induce a giggle or two from her. This demonstrates this film’s suitability for a wide range
            of audience ages. That statement may have been a blatant fib as there was a surprisingly large quantity of
            vulgar scenes, but Natalia liked it, and her opinion goes a long way. Another point of admiration from her
            was the wit of Jean Kayak, which was displayed through the creativity of his traps. While the actual nature
            of the plot was silly, the intelligence required to create the absurdities in the film was somewhat
            brilliant. To add on to this praise, Morgen, a fellow member of the audience, pointed out the unpredictable
            nature of the plot. There was seemingly very little reasoning to the sequence of events. You could try your
            best to guess what happens next, but it was just too random for your guess to be anywhere close to the
            correct answer. This chaos added layers of excitement to the film, keeping the viewers alert and intrigued.
            Both of these viewpoints were great examples of audience perception, especially from an amateur movie-goer
            standpoint. Our next interviewee is an avid film enthusiast and the ringleader of our small movie-going
            community. She rallies troops for frequent ventures out to Cinemapolis, and seeing “Hundreds of Beavers” was
            indeed her idea. Laura’s favourite thing about this film was “the visceral butcher scenes. Even though it
            was just a plush beaver, it was uncomfortable and violent.” Unfortunately, this is a direct quote. If the
            ringleader enjoyed this film, then you know it must be good. These positive reactions come as no surprise.
            With this film’s unconventional nature, there are many different elements that can be admired from amateur
            movie watchers and cinephiles alike.

            Although this slapstick comedy airs on the side of ridiculousness, there are surprisingly deep themes
            integrated into this absurd little plot. The simple setup invites the audience to delve into much deeper and
            elegant underlying meanings. If you’re not carefully paying attention, you may come to the conclusion that
            this film is painfully juvenile and immature. At its most basic form, this movie appears to just be people
            wearing animal costumes and playing in the snow. But in slightly more advanced forms, it explores advanced
            themes of persistence and complex character development.

        </p>
        <p>
            At first, Kayak struggles with painfully simple tasks. He cannot start a fire, he gets his ass kicked by
            bunny rabbits, and he cannot impress a woman. Every attempt at survival ends with a fumbled result— either
            in his own injury or, even worse, humiliation. But the long, and emphasis on long, series of attempts and
            their subsequent failures never act as a deterrent. Instead of accepting defeat, he analyzes his failures
            for what they are. Assessing the flaws in his actions highlights what he can do to improve in his next
            attempt. To Kayak, no time is time spent poorly— he either finds success in his actions, or he highlights
            what he can improve upon to be more successful in the future. This repetition serves both as comedic
            purposes and a means of personal growth. The preparation, execution, and revision cycle acts to develop an
            important theme of persistence. While this slapstick comedy is never meant to be taken seriously, this
            undertone of determination plays a large role in the success of this film.

        </p>
        <p>
            Another takeaway from this theme of persistence could be the transformation of the purpose of his actions.
            There is a critical shifting point from survival to thriving. In the beginning of the film, he is hunting
            out of hunger. Well at least trying to hunt. Initially, the rabbits would always outsmart him, which
            highlighted the flaws in his traps and methods. However, each hole in his plans was revised through this
            trial-and-error learning curve. Persisting through his failures allowed him to find success, and a warm
            meal. Eventually, after his techniques advanced enough to fill his belly, his purpose was no longer to
            provide for himself and survive. His main motivator transitioned from feeding himself into impressing the
            tradesman’s daughter, who he had become quite infatuated with. The tradesman’s condition was he could ask
            for his daughter’s hand in marriage if he brought him one hundred beavers. Although this was a large ask, he
            was going to stop at nothing to make this a reality. It is easy to doubt Kayak at the beginning of the film.
            His plans he devises are initially very foolish and, quite frankly, stupid. His low intellect is not one to
            be admired. However, he does not remain this simple-minded version of himself. Throughout the film, he grows
            and develops as an individual, and this determination is one thing that anyone can respect.

        </p>
        <p>
            The truth is, perhaps I would not have been able to watch and enjoy this movie to the same extent if I
            hadn’t seen it in this specific theatre and with these specific people. One’s enjoyment of content is truly
            impacted by the circumstance under which they are consuming it. If I was watching it alone and in the
            comfort of my own home, perhaps I would not have been amazed to the same extent. However, I’d like to
            believe this was an excellent film no matter the viewing environment. To any and all that disagree with the
            notion that “Hundreds of Beavers” is anything less than an excellent film, they likely only enjoy their
            cookie cutter movies with simple dialogue and unoriginal plots. If I didn’t like excitement or change, maybe
            I would feel the same way. Instead, I am grateful for my unique viewing experiences, and “Hundreds of
            Beavers” truly transcended all expectations.
