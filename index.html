    <p style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 70%;">In this course, students read works of literary, cultural, music, art,
        and film criticism aimed at
        a popular audience, from a range of magazines and other publications. Students discussed what makes a successful
        work of criticism, why we read criticism, and how criticism has changed over time. All readings were of essay
        length, by authors including George Orwell, Zadie Smith, and Joan Didion. Writing assignments included
        analysis of works of criticism and criticism in practice, where students applied what they have learned to write
        and
        revise a critical essay on a topic of their choice. </p>
